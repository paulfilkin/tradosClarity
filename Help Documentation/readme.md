## Troubleshooting

### Quick Navigation isn't working

**Possible solutions:**

- Make sure the Trados page has focus (click on it first)
- Verify you're on a supported Trados Cloud page (*.trados.com)
- Try refreshing the page to re-initialize the extension
- Check that the extension is enabled in Chrome's extension settings

### Navigation dialog shows but sections are missing

**This is normal!** Different Trados pages have different sections:

- **Projects page:** Has all 4 sections (Main Menu, Sub-tabs, Actions, Table)
- **Customers page:** Has 3 sections (no sub-tabs)
- **Some pages** may only have main menu and actions

The extension automatically detects what's available on each page.

### Navigation shortcuts aren't working

**Possible solutions:**

- Make sure the Trados page has focus (click on it first)
- Check if another application is using the same shortcut
- Try customizing the shortcut to a different key combination
- Verify the extension is active on the current page

### Tours aren't announcing properly

**Possible solutions:**

- Ensure your screen reader is running and configured for dynamic content
- Refresh the page to re-initialize the extension
- Check that the extension is enabled in Chrome's extension settings

### Important buttons aren't being found

**Possible solutions:**

- Make sure the page has fully loaded before using the shortcut
- Navigate to the appropriate page/workflow first (some buttons only appear in specific contexts)
- Try using the shortcut multiple times - content may load dynamically
- Check if you're on a supported Trados Cloud page

### Extension not working

**Possible solutions:**

- Verify you're on a Trados Cloud domain (*.trados.com)
